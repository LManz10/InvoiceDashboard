# EDIFACT-VAL

EDIFACT-VAL is an automatic tool to validate the content of EDIFACT messages using Knowledge Graphs technologies. 

## Overview 

The EIDFACT-VAL tool contains the following steps: 

1: Invoice Pre-Processing:
  - Translation of the edifact invoices into XML files

2: RDF Graph Creation of Invoices: 
  - YARRRML Mapping 
  - RML Mapping

3: RDF Validation:  
  - Constraints based on EDIFACT guidelines and reports based on domain experts  

All these steps are combined into one Python program called [EDIFACT-Val](https://github.com/DE-TUM/EDIFACT-VAL/blob/62012cbf7096ae49aa0e709bdfe87074a5f21836/src2/edifact-val.py).
